# Maman 11 - CPP programs  
In this maman there are 4 assigments, I put each answer to a question in a different folder.  
The first solution is just a pdf file.
The second solution contains 3 files: headers, implementation and an exe compiled with the command: "g++ my_vec.cpp -o 2.exe"
The third solution contains 5 files: 2 headers, 2 implementation and an exe compiled with the command: "g++ 3\all_vecs.cpp 2\my_vec.cpp 3\named_vector.cpp -o 3.exe" This is because question 3 refers to question 2.  
The forth solution contains 2 files and a folder that contains 2 more files: The implementation and it's compiled exe, This time there is no headers file beacuse I didn't write it as a class that other files will use. The forth solution folder contatins a subfolder with the example input and output of the program. The compiled binary was compiled with the command: "g++ read_csv.cpp -0 4.exe"
